ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Brenda.
I'm a Software Engineering student, a field that introduced me to the world of technology. Throughout my studies, I've gone beyond the classroom by participating in events, research groups, and a variety of projects, which allowed me to explore different technologies and methodologies.

I enjoy applying what I learn in Software Engineering to enhance and optimize every project I work on â€” whether it's academic, professional, or personal. Lately, I've been exploring game development and computer vision, both of which are part of my graduation project and my personal interests. ðŸš€ðŸŽ®ðŸ§
